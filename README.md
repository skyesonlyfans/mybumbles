Welcome to the Bumbles Simulation! This document will help you understand what you're seeing on the screen.
Visual Key & Symbols
Hereâ€™s a quick guide to the different visual cues for bumbles and cities:
Bumbles
 * ðŸ‘‘ Gold Crown: This bumble is a President, the leader of a province. They are larger, immortal, and command their province's military.
 * ðŸ”µ Blue Body: A male bumble.
 * ðŸŒ¸ Pink Body: A female bumble.
 * ðŸŸ¢ Green Body: An infected (zombie) bumble.
 * âž• White Cross: This bumble is a Scientist. They stay within their city and cure any infections that arise.
 * ðŸŒŸ Yellow Outline: This bumble is a Founder, currently in the process of establishing a new city.
 * ðŸŽ¨ Colored Halo: A bumble with a colored halo is a Soldier engaged in combat. The color of the halo matches their home province's color.
Cities & Provinces
 * ðŸŽ¨ Colored Territory Circle: The large, faint circle around a city represents its province's territory. All cities belonging to the same province will share the same color.
 * ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Territory Circle: A city with a yellow circle has not yet grown large enough to form its own province.
Important Notes & Mechanics
 * Ambition: This is a core genetic trait. Bumbles with high ambition are more likely to leave crowded cities to explore and found new settlements.
 * Population Caps: Each city has a maximum population of 30. The entire world has a hard population cap of 1350 bumbles.
 * Colonization: When a city reaches its population cap of 30, it will send out one male and one female scout to establish a new city elsewhere in the world.
 * Provinces: A city must reach a population of 20 to establish a new province (up to a maximum of 4 provinces in the world). The first President is chosen from the founding members.
 * Rebellion: If one province becomes too powerful and conquers all others, the most ambitious bumbles within that empire will eventually leave to start a new province, ensuring the world remains dynamic.
 * Evolution:
   * After Day 3, bumbles learn to build churches.
   * After Day 20, the strongest cities will develop defensive turrets to protect against invaders.
